    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a rapidly growing field with numerous applications in modern technology and communication systems. The ability to process, analyze and manipulate signals in the digital domain has revolutionized fields such as audio and speech processing, image and video processing, communications, control systems, and biomedical engineering. Learning DSP enables one to understand the theory and techniques used to, for example process signals in real-time, which has a wide range of applications in areas such as speech recognition, noise reduction, image compression, and many others. Hence, it is a valuable skill for individuals interested in careers in electronics, telecommunications, and computer engineering.\n",
