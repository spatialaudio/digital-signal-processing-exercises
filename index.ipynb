    "# Literature \n",
    "\n",
    "## English Monographs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some classic and often cited textbooks on DSP. I regularly have a look in one of the following, sorted to my current personal preference: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A.V. Oppenheim, R.W. Schafer (2010): \"Discrete-Time Signal Processing.\", Pearson, Upper Saddle River, 3rd ed. Also in German.\n",
    "\n",
    "- L.R. Rabiner, B. Gold (1975): \"Theory And Application Of Digital Signal Processing.\", Pearson, Englewood Cliffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- E.C. Ifeachor, B. W. Jervis (2002): \"Digital Signal Processing.\", Prentice Hall, Harlow, 2nd ed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- B. Girod, R. Rabenstein, A. Stenger (2001): \"Signals and Systems.\" Wiley, Chichester. Also a 4th ed. in German.\n",
    "\n",
    "- R.G. Lyons (2011): \"Understanding Digital Signal Processing.\", Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, 3rd ed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- S.D. Stearns, D.R. Hush (1990): \"Digital Signal Analysis.\", Prentice Hall. Also in German.\n",
    "\n",
    "- J.G. Proakis, D.G. Manolakis (1996): \"Digital Signal Processing.\", Prentice Hall, London, 3rd ed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Y. Stein (2000): \"Digital Signal Processing.\", Wiley, New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "- S. J. Orfanidis (2010): \"Introduction to Signal Processing.\", Pearson.\n",
    "\n",
    "- L.R. Rabiner, R.W. Schafer (1978): \"Digital Processing of Speech Signals.\", Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The books by Oppenheim and Rabiner could be considered as the starting point of DSP related monographs, at least in the so called western world. It is definitely worth to check them out. The didactical approach of Lyons might be worth to look at, the covered concepts are explained very extensively and step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## German Authors\n",
    "\n",
    "Since affiliated with a German university, I give some hints on German textbooks.\n",
    "Besides direct translations of English books, there exist several brilliant German textbooks as well. I regularly have a look into the books by\n",
    "\n",
    "- Norbert Fliege\n",
    "- Karl-Dirk Kammeyer\n",
    "- Hans Wilhelm Schüßler\n",
    "- Bernd Girod\n",
    "- Udo Zölzer\n",
    "- Franz-Heinrich Lange\n",
    "- Gerhard Wunsch\n",
    "- Klaus Göldner\n",
    "\n",
    "to name a few authors. If one looks for easier entry and/or less theoretical approaches, the books by\n",
    "\n",
    "- Daniel Ch. von Grünigen\n",
    "- Martin Werner\n",
    "- Martin Meyer\n",
    "- Ottmar Beucher\n",
    "\n",
    "could be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides that, there exist tons of DSP related literature as (e)-books and in the web.\n",
    "Use whatever suits best to you, but don't forget to double check and validate the found information.\n",
    "That is usually the point where I fall back to early monographs, since they are amazingly sparse of errors and cover a lot of stuff already.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Educational Resources (OER) / Open Course Ware (OCW)\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a regular look at these video/html resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alan V. Oppenheim, MIT, https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-008-digital-signal-processing-spring-2011/\n",

    "- Gert Leus, TU Delft, https://ocw.tudelft.nl/courses/digital-signal-processing/\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, although not traditionally related to DSP, it is recommended to have a look at\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gilbert Strang, MIT, Linear Algebra courses, https://ocw.mit.edu/search/ocwsearch.htm?q=gilbert%20strang\n",
    "\n",
    "since signals can be interpreted as vectors, and multiple signals as vector spaces, that might form a vector base. So, a lot of concepts of linear algebra are very useful in DSP.\n"
