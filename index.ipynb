A FIR filter application probably needs a different spectrum than an optimized window application.\n",

    "So, what role plays the DFT here? We should recall that for finite length signals all spectrum information is stored in the DFT coefficients. The DTFT can then be interpolated from the DFT coefficients, see [DFT Interpolation to DTFT](dft/dft_to_dtft_interpolation.ipynb). So, by knowing the DFT of an FIR filter, we basically know the whole frequency response of this FIR system and we can tell which frequencies in the input signal are gained/attenuated in the convolution process $y[k] = x[k] \\ast h[k]$. And, by knowing the DFT of a window, we know the frequency response of the window and are able to estimate the smoothing effect that happens in the convolution $Y(\\Omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} X(\\Omega) \\circledast_{2\\pi} W(\\Omega)$.
