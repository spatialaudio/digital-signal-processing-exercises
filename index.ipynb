A FIR filter application probably needs a different spectrum than an optimized window application.\n",

The DTFT can then be interpolated from the DFT coefficients, see [DFT Interpolation to DTFT](dft/dft_to_dtft_interpolation.ipynb). So, by knowing the DFT of an FIR filter, we basically know the whole frequency response of this FIR system and we can tell which frequencies in the input signal are gained/attenuated in the convolution process $y[k] = x[k] \\ast h[k]$. And, by knowing the DFT of a window, we know the frequency response of the window and are able to estimate the smoothing effect that happens in the convolution $Y(\\Omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} X(\\Omega) \\circledast_{2\\pi} W(\\Omega)$.
