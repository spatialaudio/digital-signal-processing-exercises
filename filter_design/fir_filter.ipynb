    "Most often, larger maximum stopband level is desired under acceptance of less steep initial roll-off. This can be achieved with other window functions. A very well suited window for this filter design task is the Kaiser-Bessel window. Kaiser figured out that a certain maximum stopband level (usually this is here the first side lobe) can be controlled by the parameter $\\beta$. This of course holds only if $M$ is chosen large enough to obtain such a damping at all.\n",
