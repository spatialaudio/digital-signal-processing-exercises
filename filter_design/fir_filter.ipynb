Depending on the application, filtering or windowing, the DTFT design criteria might be very different, since the DTFT spectrum acts as multiplication or convolution onto the input signal's DTFT spectrum. However, the design concepts and algorithms itself are basically the same, this is sometimes not so obvious in textbooks. "
