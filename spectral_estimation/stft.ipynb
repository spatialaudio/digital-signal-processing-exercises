    "# Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Periodogram\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The STFT and the inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform (iSTFT) are fundamental building blocks for digital signal processing (DSP).\n",
    "With the STFT, the time-frequency varying characteristics of a signal can be analyzed.\n",
    "Combining the STFT as the analyzing step and a subsequent iSTFT as the synthesizing/reconstruction step, builds the foundation for so called **time-frequency processing**, which is heavily used in nowadays DSP algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For certain algorithms the computational load can be considerably decreased using time-frequency processing.\n",
    "Other approaches can only be realized due to explicit usage of time-frequency processing.\n",
    "A very prominent example is the invention of [Auto-Tune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-Tune) in the late 1990s. Furthermore, all video and audio codecs work this way.\n",
    "IP-based streaming is only possible due to the transport of compressed time-frequency data rather than raw data. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider only the analysis stage, i.e. the STFT itself, we can elaborate a nice link to the periodogram: we can interpret this as a special post-processing of STFT data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It thus appears reasonable that we have a detailed look to STFT/iSTFT and their key concept within this homework assignment."

    "\n",
    "Congratulations, we have done it :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have implemented the basic blocks for STFT-based analysis and synthesis using different overlap-add methods. It is comparably simple to add the further steps such that we can apply time-frequency processing for e.g. filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then we checked in detail how a surface plot of STFT data is created. These insights and playing around with the parameters help to understand what is going on. We should get experience on our own regarding different time and different frequency resolution, zeropadding and impact of different windows. Once we set the basics here, these steps can be conveniently performed and better understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At last, we got into detail of the modified periodogram, more specifically the Welch periodogram. This is (besides parametric approaches, see the lecture) one of fundamental 'need to know' in DSP, when dealing with random data, which in practice is most often the case. Here, we also should play around with different averages, different DFT block sizes, different windows to get experience on the made up signal...and then trying other signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last reminder: After implementing stuff on our own, we might better understand the theoretical foundations and the equations of the discussed approaches. So, check back the lectures and text books, it will be enlightening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we experienced that tiny details can make big differences. So, in-depth-checking things/tools, that we employ, is always a good idea when engineering."
